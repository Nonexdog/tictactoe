# (Odin) Tic-Tac-Toe

A game of Tic-Tac-Toe that two users can play in a browser window!!

This project aims to use the following knowledge in practice:
- Avoid using as little global code as possible
- Better object instantiation using **Factory Functions**
- Use <abbr title = "Immediately Invoked Function Expressions">IIFEs</abbr> for module creation
- Apply a LOT of logic in the form of external algorithms (with a lot of rubber ducky debugging)
- Give it my own spin... on tic-tac-toe??
